                <p>Cycling tours are an immersive way to explore new landscapes. A sketchbook becomes an essential companion, capturing fleeting moments—rolling hills, hidden alleys, or the vibrant energy of a city street.</p>
                Riders often document their journeys through rough sketches, notes, and even pressed flowers from the road. Touring with a sketchbook allows cyclists to slow down and appreciate the details often missed in the rush of travel. 
                Whether capturing historic architecture or a stunning sunset, these pages become cherished keepsakes, preserving the adventure in a way photographs cannot.
