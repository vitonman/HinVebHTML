                <h2>Product Review: All baskets were not created equal</h2>
                <p> When it comes to bicycle baskets, not all are created equal. Some prioritize style, while others emphasize durability and capacity. Wicker baskets provide a vintage aesthetic but can struggle under heavy loads, while metal wire baskets offer sturdiness but may not be as visually appealing. Modern designs, such as quick-release baskets, allow for greater versatility, enabling cyclists to detach and carry them like shopping bags. </p>
                <p>With growing urban cycling trends, selecting the right basket depends on individual needs—whether it’s for commuting, grocery shopping, or simply enhancing the bike’s look. The key is to find a balance between functionality and design.</p>

                <h2>Going Public: Out & about with the founder of Public</h2>
                <p>Public Bikes has revolutionized urban cycling, making stylish and functional city bikes more accessible. The company's founder, Rob Forbes, envisioned a world where people preferred two wheels over four, creating bicycles that are both practical and elegant. Public’s Dutch-style bikes prioritize comfort with upright riding positions, wide tires, and simple gear mechanisms.</p>
                <p>As more cities invest in bike-friendly infrastructure, the demand for these urban-focused bicycles has grown. Forbes continues to advocate for sustainable mobility, believing that well-designed bicycles can influence lifestyle changes, encouraging people to embrace cycling for daily commutes and leisure.</p>

                <h2>Cycle Lane Defence: Know your rights</h2>
                <img src="/images/more3.jpg" alt="The road ahead" />
                <p>Cyclists often face challenges when navigating urban streets, including reckless drivers, unclear traffic laws, and a lack of dedicated cycling infrastructure. However, understanding legal rights can help ensure a safer ride. In many cities, cyclists are entitled to the full lane when necessary for safety, and laws require vehicles to maintain a minimum passing distance.</p>
