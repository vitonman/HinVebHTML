                <h2>Bicycle Hall of Fame: The 1958 Schwinn Spitfire</h2>
                <p>The Schwinn Spitfire, first introduced in 1958, remains one of the most iconic bicycles in American history. Designed as a rugged and reliable cruiser, it gained popularity among young riders and enthusiasts who valued durability. Its heavy steel frame, balloon tires, and simple coaster brakes made it a low-maintenance yet stylish choice. Unlike modern lightweight road bikes, the Spitfire was built to last, surviving rough urban streets and long rides.</p>
                 <p>Today, vintage bicycle collectors hunt for well-preserved models, as this piece of history embodies the golden age of American cycling, when bikes were the primary mode of childhood transportation.</p>
