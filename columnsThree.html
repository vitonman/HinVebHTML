    <h1>The Evolution of the Bicycle</h1>
    <div class="column1of3">
        <h3>The First Bicycle</h3>
        <p>
            In 1817 baron von Drais invented a walking machine that
            would help him get around the royal gardens faster.

            1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type 
            and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.

            The next appearance of a two-wheeled riding machine was in 
            1865, then pedals were applied directly to the front wheel.
            This machine was known as the velocipede (meaning "fast foot")
            as well as the "bone shaker", since it is wooden structure.
        </p>
        <p>
            The front wheels became larger and larger as makers realized
            that the larger the wheel, the farther you could travle with one
            rotation of the pedals. These bicycles enjoyed  a great
            popularity during the 1880s amoung young mens. (They cost
            an avarage worker six months pay).
